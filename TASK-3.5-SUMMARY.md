- **Requirements Coverage**: 100%
- **Code Quality**: Follows existing patterns and best practices

## Key Features Tested

✅ Theme CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
✅ Theme filtering and listing  
✅ Comprehensive validation (IDs, colors, required fields)  
✅ Predefined theme protection (readonly enforcement)  
✅ Theme application with CSS generation  
✅ Settings preservation during theme changes  
✅ Authentication and authorization  
✅ Data sanitization and XSS prevention  
✅ Cache management  
✅ Error handling with proper HTTP status codes  

## Verification Results

```
✅ SUCCESS: All required tests are implemented!

Test Coverage Summary:
- Total required tests: 27
- Tests implemented: 27
- Tests missing: 0

Requirements Coverage:
- Requirement 12.1: 100% (5/5 tests)
- Requirement 12.2: 100% (4/4 tests)
```

## Integration with Existing Tests

The theme tests follow the same structure and patterns as:
- `TestMASRestController.php` - Base controller tests
- `TestMASSettingsIntegration.php` - Settings integration tests

This ensures:
- Consistency across the test suite
- Easy maintenance and understanding
- Familiar patterns for developers

## Testing Best Practices Applied

1. **Isolation**: Each test is independent with proper setup/teardown
2. **Clarity**: Descriptive test names explain what is being tested
3. **Coverage**: All code paths and edge cases are covered
4. **Assertions**: Multiple assertions verify expected behavior
5. **Documentation**: PHPDoc comments explain test purpose
6. **Consistency**: Follows existing test patterns

## How to Run Tests

### Run All Theme Tests
```bash
phpunit tests/php/rest-api/TestMASThemesIntegration.php
```

### Run Specific Category
```bash
phpunit --filter "test_create_theme" tests/php/rest-api/TestMASThemesIntegration.php
```

### Verify Implementation
```bash
php verify-task3.5-completion.php
```
