# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Modern Admin Styler V2 (MAS3) WordPress plugin is currently in a critical state with approximately 90% of functionality non-operational due to over-aggressive refactoring. This repair project aims to systematically restore full functionality through a three-phase approach: Emergency Stabilization, Architecture Repair, and Full Feature Restoration. The plugin provides advanced WordPress admin interface styling capabilities including custom color palettes, glassmorphism effects, floating menus, and live preview functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Emergency Stabilization

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want basic admin interface styling to work immediately, so that my WordPress admin is functional and visually enhanced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is activated THEN the CSS generation function SHALL produce valid CSS output
2. WHEN admin-menu-modern.css is loaded THEN basic menu styling SHALL be applied to the WordPress admin
3. WHEN quick-fix.css is loaded THEN critical UI elements SHALL display correctly
4. WHEN hovering over menu items in floating mode THEN submenus SHALL appear and be accessible
5. WHEN viewing the admin interface THEN there SHALL be no JavaScript console errors related to the plugin
6. WHEN basic color settings are applied THEN menu background colors SHALL update correctly

### Requirement 2: Architecture Repair

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the modular JavaScript system to work properly, so that all plugin features are accessible and settings can be saved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin loads THEN ModernAdminApp SHALL initialize without dependency errors
2. WHEN module dependencies are loaded THEN the loading sequence SHALL complete successfully
3. WHEN live preview is enabled THEN CSS variables SHALL update in real-time as settings change
4. WHEN settings are modified THEN changes SHALL persist correctly in the WordPress database
5. WHEN the settings interface is accessed THEN all UI tabs SHALL be responsive and accessible
6. WHEN JavaScript modules are loaded THEN the mas-loader.js SHALL properly manage module dependencies

### Requirement 3: Full Feature Restoration

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want all advanced styling features to work completely, so that I can fully customize my WordPress admin interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN glassmorphism effects are enabled THEN transparent blur effects SHALL render correctly across all browsers
2. WHEN shadow effects are applied THEN CSS shadows SHALL display properly on menu elements
3. WHEN animations are enabled THEN smooth transitions SHALL occur during menu interactions
4. WHEN color palette system is used THEN predefined color schemes SHALL apply correctly
5. WHEN export settings is clicked THEN current configuration SHALL be exported as a valid JSON file
6. WHEN import settings is used THEN valid configuration files SHALL restore all plugin settings
7. WHEN performance optimization is enabled THEN plugin SHALL load efficiently without memory issues

### Requirement 4: WordPress Compatibility

**User Story:** As a WordPress site owner, I want the plugin to work seamlessly with WordPress core, so that it doesn't break existing functionality or cause conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is active THEN WordPress core admin functionality SHALL remain unaffected
2. WHEN other plugins are active THEN there SHALL be no CSS or JavaScript conflicts
3. WHEN WordPress is updated THEN the plugin SHALL continue to function correctly
4. WHEN the plugin is deactivated THEN WordPress admin SHALL return to default styling without residual effects
5. WHEN WordPress coding standards are applied THEN all PHP code SHALL pass WordPress validation
6. WHEN security audits are performed THEN no vulnerabilities SHALL be present in the codebase

### Requirement 5: Performance and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want the plugin to perform efficiently and be maintainable, so that it doesn't slow down my site or become difficult to update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin loads THEN memory usage SHALL not exceed reasonable WordPress plugin standards
2. WHEN CSS is generated THEN file sizes SHALL be optimized for web delivery
3. WHEN JavaScript executes THEN performance SHALL not impact WordPress admin responsiveness
4. WHEN code is modified THEN changes SHALL be documented with clear reasoning
5. WHEN future maintenance is needed THEN code structure SHALL be easily understandable
6. WHEN cross-browser testing is performed THEN functionality SHALL work in all modern browsers

### Requirement 6: Data Integrity and Recovery

**User Story:** As a WordPress administrator, I want my plugin settings to be safe and recoverable, so that I don't lose my customizations during the repair process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repair begins THEN existing user settings SHALL be backed up automatically
2. WHEN settings are migrated THEN no user configuration data SHALL be lost
3. WHEN errors occur during repair THEN rollback mechanisms SHALL restore previous working state
4. WHEN plugin is updated THEN user customizations SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN database operations occur THEN data integrity SHALL be maintained throughout the process
6. WHEN backup restoration is needed THEN previous configurations SHALL be fully recoverable
