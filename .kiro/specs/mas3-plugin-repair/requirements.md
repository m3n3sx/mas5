# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Modern Admin Styler V2 plugin is experiencing a critical WordPress error that prevents the site from loading. The error message "There has been a critical error on this website" indicates a fatal PHP error is occurring during plugin initialization. Based on the codebase analysis, the issue stems from the REST API infrastructure attempting to load controller classes that extend `WP_REST_Controller` before WordPress has fully initialized the REST API framework.

This is a critical production issue that requires immediate resolution to restore site functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Fatal Error on Plugin Load

**User Story:** As a WordPress site administrator, I want the plugin to load without causing fatal errors, so that my website remains accessible to visitors and I can access the admin panel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is activated THEN the WordPress site SHALL load without fatal errors
2. WHEN WordPress initializes THEN the plugin SHALL only load REST API controllers after `WP_REST_Controller` class is available
3. IF the plugin encounters a loading error THEN it SHALL log the error details for debugging without breaking the site
4. WHEN the REST API is initialized THEN all controller files SHALL be loaded safely within the `rest_api_init` hook

### Requirement 2: Implement Safe Class Loading

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the plugin to use lazy loading for REST API controllers, so that classes are only loaded when WordPress is ready to support them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin initializes THEN it SHALL NOT require controller files during the constructor phase
2. WHEN `rest_api_init` fires THEN the system SHALL verify `WP_REST_Controller` exists before loading controllers
3. IF `WP_REST_Controller` is not available THEN the system SHALL log a warning and gracefully skip REST API initialization
4. WHEN controller files are loaded THEN they SHALL be loaded only once to prevent duplicate class declarations

### Requirement 3: Add Error Handling and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want clear error messages when something goes wrong, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fatal error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including file, line number, and stack trace
2. WHEN the plugin cannot initialize properly THEN it SHALL display an admin notice explaining the issue
3. IF WordPress version is incompatible THEN the system SHALL prevent activation with a clear error message
4. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging of the initialization sequence

### Requirement 4: Verify Fix Across WordPress Versions

**User Story:** As a plugin maintainer, I want the fix to work across supported WordPress versions, so that all users can safely use the plugin.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tested on WordPress 5.8+ THEN the plugin SHALL activate and function without errors
2. WHEN tested on WordPress 6.0+ THEN the REST API SHALL initialize correctly
3. WHEN tested on the latest WordPress version THEN all features SHALL work as expected
4. IF running on an unsupported WordPress version THEN the system SHALL prevent activation with a helpful message
