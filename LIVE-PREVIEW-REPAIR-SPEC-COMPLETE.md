## Problem Statement

The live preview system in Modern Admin Styler V2 is not working. When users change settings (colors, sizes, etc.), the preview does not update in real-time.

## Solution Approach

**Diagnostic-First Strategy:**
1. Run diagnostic tests to identify the exact failure point
2. Add comprehensive logging and error handling
3. Fix the broken component(s)
4. Verify all setting types work
5. Optimize performance

**Key Improvements:**
- Diagnostic system with clear logging
- Enhanced event binding for all input types
- Robust AJAX communication with validation
- CSS injection with verification
- Server-side logging and error handling
- Performance optimization (debouncing)

---

## How to Start Implementation

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic Test

Open in browser:
```
http://your-site.com/wp-content/plugins/modern-admin-styler-v2/test-live-preview-diagnostic.php
```

This will show you which component is broken.

### Step 2: Open Tasks File

Navigate to: `.kiro/specs/live-preview-repair/tasks.md`

### Step 3: Start with Task 1

Click "Start task" next to Task 1 to begin implementation.

### Step 4: Follow the Plan

Work through each task sequentially. Each task has:
- Clear objective
- Specific code changes
- Requirements references
- Verification steps

---

## Files to Modify

### JavaScript (1 file)
- `assets/js/simple-live-preview.js`
  - Add diagnostic system
  - Enhance event binding
  - Improve AJAX communication
  - Add CSS injection function

### PHP (1 file)
- `modern-admin-styler-v2.php`
  - Enhance `ajaxGetPreviewCSS()` method
  - Add debug logging
  - Improve error handling
  - Enhance response data

---

## Expected Outcome

### Before Fix
- ❌ Live preview doesn't work
- ❌ No visual feedback when changing settings
- ❌ No error messages
- ❌ Hard to troubleshoot

### After Fix
- ✅ Live preview works for all setting types
- ✅ Changes appear within 500ms
- ✅ Clear diagnostic messages in console
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Performance optimized (debounced)
- ✅ Works in all major browsers

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Live preview not working at all

**Solution:**
1. Run `test-live-preview-diagnostic.php`
2. Check which test fails
3. Fix that specific component

### Issue: Console shows "masV2Global is not defined"

**Solution:**
- Script not properly localized
- Check `wp_localize_script()` call in PHP
- Verify script handle matches

### Issue: Console shows "AJAX request failed"

**Solution:**
- Check nonce is valid
- Check user has permissions
- Check server error logs
- Verify AJAX handler is registered

### Issue: Changes not visible

**Solution:**
- Check if CSS is generated (console logs)
- Check if CSS is injected (inspect `<head>`)
- Check CSS selectors match DOM
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
