# Task 4 Implementation Summary

## Quick Overview

✅ **Task 4: Phase 3: Backup and Restore Endpoints** - COMPLETED

All subtasks completed successfully:
- ✅ 4.1 Create backup service class
- ✅ 4.2 Implement backups REST controller  
- ✅ 4.3 Add backup validation and rollback
- ✅ 4.4 Update JavaScript client with backup methods

## What Was Built

### 1. Backend (PHP)

**Backup Service** (`includes/services/class-mas-backup-service.php`)
- Complete backup CRUD operations
- Automatic backup creation before major changes
- Smart cleanup (30-day retention, max 10 automatic, max 20 manual)
- Backup validation and version compatibility checks
- Rollback mechanism for failed restores

**REST Controller** (`includes/api/class-mas-backups-controller.php`)
- 6 REST API endpoints for backup management
- Proper authentication and permission checks
- JSON Schema validation
- Pagination support

### 2. Frontend (JavaScript)

**REST Client Methods** (`assets/js/mas-rest-client.js`)
- `listBackups()` - Get all backups
- `createBackup(options)` - Create new backup
- `restoreBackup(backupId)` - Restore backup
- `deleteBackup(backupId)` - Delete backup

**Backup Manager** (`assets/js/modules/BackupManager.js`)
- High-level backup operations with UI feedback
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- Progress indicators for all operations
- Custom event system for UI integration
- Backup export to JSON file
- Relative time formatting

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Backups**: Created before major changes (like reset)
2. **Smart Cleanup**: Automatically removes old backups based on policy
3. **Rollback Protection**: Creates backup before restore, rolls back on failure
4. **Version Validation**: Checks backup compatibility before restore
5. **User Confirmations**: Asks for confirmation before restore/delete
6. **Progress Feedback**: Shows progress indicators during operations
7. **Export Capability**: Export backups as JSON files

## API Endpoints

```
GET    /wp-json/mas-v2/v1/backups              - List all backups
GET    /wp-json/mas-v2/v1/backups/{id}         - Get specific backup
POST   /wp-json/mas-v2/v1/backups              - Create backup
POST   /wp-json/mas-v2/v1/backups/{id}/restore - Restore backup
DELETE /wp-json/mas-v2/v1/backups/{id}         - Delete backup
GET    /wp-json/mas-v2/v1/backups/statistics   - Get statistics
```

## Quick Start

### JavaScript Usage

```javascript
// Create backup
await masBackupManager.createBackup('Before changes');

// List backups
const backups = await masBackupManager.listBackups();

// Restore backup (with confirmation)
await masBackupManager.restoreBackup('1234567890_abc123');

// Delete backup (with confirmation)
await masBackupManager.deleteBackup('1234567890_abc123');
```

### PHP Usage

```php
$backup_service = MAS_Backup_Service::get_instance();

// Create backup
$backup = $backup_service->create_backup(null, 'manual', 'My note');

// Restore backup
$result = $backup_service->restore_backup($backup_id);

// Cleanup old backups
$deleted = $backup_service->cleanup_old_backups();
```

## Files Created

1. `includes/services/class-mas-backup-service.php` - Backup service (500+ lines)
2. `includes/api/class-mas-backups-controller.php` - REST controller (350+ lines)
3. `assets/js/modules/BackupManager.js` - UI helper (450+ lines)
4. `test-task4-backup-endpoints.php` - Test script
5. `TASK-4-BACKUP-ENDPOINTS-COMPLETION.md` - Detailed completion report
6. `BACKUP-API-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - API reference guide
7. `TASK-4-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
php test-task4-backup-endpoints.php
```

Tests verify:
- Service class instantiation
- Controller registration
- All CRUD operations
- Validation logic
- REST API endpoints
- JavaScript methods
- UI features

## Requirements Met

All requirements from the spec have been satisfied:

- ✅ **4.1**: List backups with metadata
- ✅ **4.2**: Create backups with timestamp
- ✅ **4.3**: Restore backups with validation
- ✅ **4.4**: Delete backups
- ✅ **4.5**: Automatic cleanup based on retention
- ✅ **4.6**: Complete settings and metadata in backups
- ✅ **4.7**: Rollback on restore failure

## Next Steps

Task 4 is complete. Ready to proceed to:

**Task 5: Phase 3: Import and Export Endpoints**

This will build on the backup system to provide:
- Settings export as JSON files
- Settings import with validation
- Automatic backup before import
- Legacy format migration

## Documentation

- **Detailed Report**: `TASK-4-BACKUP-ENDPOINTS-COMPLETION.md`
- **API Reference**: `BACKUP-API-QUICK-REFERENCE.md`
- **Test Script**: `test-task4-backup-endpoints.php`

## Notes

- All code follows WordPress coding standards
- Comprehensive error handling throughout
- Security: All endpoints require `manage_options` capability
- Performance: Efficient indexing and pagination support
- UX: Confirmation dialogs and progress indicators
- Maintainability: Well-documented with PHPDoc and JSDoc
