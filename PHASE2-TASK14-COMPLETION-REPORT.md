## Key Security Implementations

### 1. Input Sanitization
```php
// Examples from codebase
'action' => sanitize_key($action),
'description' => sanitize_text_field($description),
'url' => esc_url_raw($url),
'ip_address' => filter_var($ip, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP),
```

### 2. SQL Injection Prevention
```php
// All queries use prepared statements
$query = $wpdb->prepare(
    "SELECT * FROM {$table} WHERE user_id = %d AND action = %s",
    $user_id,
    $action
);
```

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
```php
public function check_permission($request) {
    if (!current_user_can('manage_options')) {
        return new WP_Error('rest_forbidden', __('Permission denied'));
    }
    
    if (in_array($request->get_method(), ['POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'])) {
        $nonce = $request->get_header('X-WP-Nonce');
        if (!wp_verify_nonce($nonce, 'wp_rest')) {
            return new WP_Error('rest_cookie_invalid_nonce', __('Invalid nonce'));
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

### 4. Rate Limiting
```php
try {
    $this->rate_limiter->check_rate_limit('settings_save');
    // Process request...
} catch (MAS_Rate_Limit_Exception $e) {
    return new WP_REST_Response([
        'code' => 'rate_limit_exceeded',
        'message' => $e->getMessage(),
    ], 429, ['Retry-After' => $e->get_retry_after()]);
}
```

### 5. Audit Logging
```php
$this->security_logger->log_event(
    'settings_updated',
    'Settings updated successfully',
    [
        'old_value' => $old_settings,
        'new_value' => $new_settings,
        'status' => 'success',
    ]
);
```

### 6. Webhook Security
```php
// HMAC signature generation
$signature = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $webhook['secret']);

// Secure delivery
$response = wp_remote_post($webhook['url'], [
    'headers' => [
        'X-MAS-Signature' => $signature,
        'X-MAS-Event' => $event,
    ],
    'body' => $payload,
    'timeout' => 30,
    'sslverify' => true,
]);
```

## Performance Impact

### Database Indexes
All security tables include proper indexes:
```sql
-- Audit log indexes
KEY user_id (user_id),
KEY action (action),
KEY timestamp (timestamp),
KEY ip_address (ip_address),
KEY status (status)

-- Webhook indexes
KEY active (active)

-- Delivery indexes
KEY webhook_id (webhook_id),
KEY status (status),
KEY next_retry_at (next_retry_at)
```

### Caching
- Rate limit counters use WordPress transients
- Automatic expiration based on time windows
- No database queries for rate limit checks

### Cleanup
- Audit log: Keeps last 10,000 entries
- Automatic cleanup on new entries
- Prevents database bloat
