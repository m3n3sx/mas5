- Error recovery mechanisms

**Functionality Testing:**
- CSS style injection
- Preview area updates
- Setting change responsiveness
- Fallback behavior

**Tests Performed:**
- Script independence check
- CSS injection testing
- AJAX capability verification
- Error handling validation

## Running the Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
# Run all tests
./run-phase3-cleanup-tests.sh

# Run PHP tests only
php test-phase3-cleanup-verification.php

# Open browser tests
open test-phase3-cleanup-frontend.html
```

### Detailed Testing Process

1. **Automated Testing:**
   ```bash
   ./run-phase3-cleanup-tests.sh
   ```
   This runs all file system and basic functionality tests.

2. **PHP Verification:**
   ```bash
   php test-phase3-cleanup-verification.php
   ```
   This provides detailed analysis of the cleanup status.

3. **Browser Testing:**
   Open `test-phase3-cleanup-frontend.html` in a browser to test:
   - JavaScript functionality
   - Form interactions
   - Live preview features
   - Error handling

4. **Manual Verification:**
   - Check WordPress admin interface
   - Test settings form submission
   - Verify live preview functionality
   - Monitor browser console for errors

## Expected Results

### Success Criteria

**All Tests Pass When:**
- All Phase 3 files are completely removed
- Required Phase 2 files exist and are functional
- Form submission works with REST API and AJAX fallback
- Live preview operates independently
- No JavaScript errors in browser console
- Performance improvements are measurable

### Success Indicators

**File System:**
- ✅ 14+ Phase 3 files removed
- ✅ 2 required Phase 2 files present
- ✅ Empty or removed core/components directories

**Functionality:**
- ✅ Form handler loads and functions
- ✅ Live preview works without dependencies
- ✅ Error handling mechanisms active
- ✅ Fallback systems operational

**Performance:**
- ✅ Reduced HTTP requests (14+ fewer files)
- ✅ Smaller JavaScript bundle (~70KB+ reduction)
- ✅ No 404 errors from missing files
- ✅ Faster page load times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Phase 3 Files Still Present:**
- Check if cleanup tasks 2-5 were completed
- Verify file permissions for deletion
- Look for backup copies or cached versions

**Form Handler Not Working:**
- Verify `mas-settings-form-handler.js` exists
- Check WordPress AJAX URL configuration
- Ensure jQuery is loaded
- Verify nonce generation

**Live Preview Issues:**
- Check `simple-live-preview.js` loading
- Verify CSS injection capability
- Test AJAX endpoint availability
- Check for JavaScript errors

**Script Enqueuing Problems:**
- Review `modern-admin-styler-v2.php` enqueue functions
- Check for Phase 3 script references
- Verify dependency declarations
- Test in WordPress admin environment

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check file existence
ls -la assets/js/core/
ls -la assets/js/components/

# Verify script content
grep -r "EventBus\|StateManager" assets/js/
grep -r "mas-admin-app" *.php

# Test PHP syntax
php -l test-phase3-cleanup-verification.php

# Check JavaScript syntax (if node available)
node -c assets/js/mas-settings-form-handler.js
node -c assets/js/simple-live-preview.js
```

## Integration with CI/CD

The test suite is designed for automation:

```bash
# Exit code 0 = all tests pass
# Exit code 1 = some tests failed
./run-phase3-cleanup-tests.sh

# JSON output for parsing
php test-phase3-cleanup-verification.php?format=json
```

## Maintenance

**Regular Testing:**
- Run tests after any JavaScript changes
- Verify after WordPress updates
- Check before production deployments
- Monitor for regression issues

**Test Updates:**
- Add new Phase 3 files to removal list if discovered
- Update required file list as system evolves
- Enhance error detection capabilities
- Improve performance measurement accuracy

## Conclusion

This comprehensive test suite ensures that the Phase 3 cleanup is thorough and that the resulting Phase 2 fallback system is stable and functional. Regular execution of these tests helps maintain system integrity and prevents regression issues.
