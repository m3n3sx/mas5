# Phase 2 Task 7: Webhook Support - Implementation Summary

## Task Overview
Implemented comprehensive webhook support for external integrations, allowing third-party systems to receive real-time notifications when plugin events occur.

## What Was Built

### 1. Webhook Service (`class-mas-webhook-service.php`)
A complete webhook management system with:
- Database tables for webhooks and delivery tracking
- Webhook registration with URL validation
- Event-based triggering system
- HMAC-SHA256 signature generation
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Delivery history tracking

### 2. Webhooks REST Controller (`class-mas-webhooks-controller.php`)
Full REST API for webhook management:
- `GET /webhooks` - List webhooks
- `POST /webhooks` - Register webhook
- `GET /webhooks/{id}` - Get webhook details
- `PUT /webhooks/{id}` - Update webhook
- `DELETE /webhooks/{id}` - Delete webhook
- `GET /webhooks/{id}/deliveries` - Get delivery history
- `GET /webhooks/events` - List supported events

### 3. Event Integration
Webhooks automatically triggered for:
- **settings.updated** - When plugin settings are saved
- **theme.applied** - When a theme is applied
- **backup.created** - When a backup is created
- **backup.restored** - When a backup is restored

### 4. JavaScript Client Methods
Added to `MASRestClient`:
- `listWebhooks(params)`
- `registerWebhook(url, events, secret)`
- `getWebhook(webhookId)`
- `updateWebhook(webhookId, data)`
- `deleteWebhook(webhookId)`
- `getWebhookDeliveries(webhookId, params)`
- `getSupportedWebhookEvents()`

## Key Features

### Secure Delivery
- HMAC-SHA256 signatures on all webhook deliveries
- Signature sent in `X-MAS-Signature` header
- Recipients can verify authenticity

### Reliable Delivery
- Automatic retry on failure (up to 5 attempts)
- Exponential backoff: 60s, 120s, 240s, 480s, 960s
- Delivery status tracking (pending, success, failed)

### Comprehensive Tracking
- Full delivery history per webhook
- Response codes and error messages stored
- Attempt count tracking
- Timestamps for all events

### Developer-Friendly
- REST API for all operations
- JavaScript client for easy integration
- Detailed event payloads
- Clear documentation

## Usage Example

### Register a Webhook
```javascript
const webhook = await masRestClient.registerWebhook(
  'https://your-app.com/webhook',
  ['settings.updated', 'theme.applied']
);
// Returns: { id, url, events, secret, active, created_at }
```

### Receive Webhook
```php
// Verify signature
$signature = $_SERVER['HTTP_X_MAS_SIGNATURE'];
$payload = file_get_contents('php://input');
$expected = hash_hmac('sha256', $payload, $your_secret);

if (hash_equals($expected, $signature)) {
  $data = json_decode($payload, true);
  // Process event: $data['event'], $data['timestamp'], etc.
}
```

### Check Delivery History
```javascript
const deliveries = await masRestClient.getWebhookDeliveries(
  webhookId,
  { status: 'failed', limit: 20 }
);
```

## Database Schema

### Webhooks Table
- Stores webhook URL, events, secret, active status
- Indexed on active status for fast filtering

### Deliveries Table
- Tracks every delivery attempt
- Stores payload, status, response, errors
- Indexed on webhook_id, status, next_retry_at

## Testing

Test file: `test-phase2-task7-webhooks.php`

Tests cover:
- Database table creation
- Webhook registration and validation
- Event triggering
- Delivery tracking
- REST API endpoints
- JavaScript client methods

## Integration Points

### Modified Files
1. `includes/class-mas-rest-api.php` - Added webhook controller registration
2. `includes/api/class-mas-rest-controller.php` - Added `trigger_webhook()` helper
3. `includes/api/class-mas-settings-controller.php` - Triggers on save/update
4. `includes/api/class-mas-themes-controller.php` - Triggers on theme apply
5. `includes/api/class-mas-backups-controller.php` - Triggers on create/restore
6. `assets/js/mas-rest-client.js` - Added webhook methods

## Requirements Met

✅ **10.1** - Webhooks triggered on settings save, theme apply, backup operations
✅ **10.2** - POST /webhooks registers webhook with URL and events
✅ **10.3** - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff implemented
✅ **10.4** - Delivery history endpoint with full tracking
✅ **10.5** - Authentication via WordPress nonces and HMAC signatures
✅ **10.6** - JavaScript SDK with typed interfaces
✅ **10.7** - Rate limiting inherited from base controller

## Performance Notes

- Webhook delivery is synchronous but doesn't block main operations
- Failed deliveries queued for retry with exponential backoff
- Database properly indexed for fast queries
- Retry processing can be run via cron job

## Security Features

- HMAC-SHA256 signatures prevent tampering
- Secrets hidden in API responses
- URL validation before registration
- Event validation (only supported events)
- Full WordPress authentication required
- All operations audit logged

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
1. Admin UI for webhook management
2. Webhook testing interface
3. Automatic cleanup of old deliveries
4. Webhook templates for popular services
5. Delivery analytics dashboard

## Files Created

1. `includes/services/class-mas-webhook-service.php` (600+ lines)
2. `includes/api/class-mas-webhooks-controller.php` (400+ lines)
3. `test-phase2-task7-webhooks.php` (test file)
4. `PHASE2-TASK7-COMPLETION-REPORT.md` (documentation)
5. `PHASE2-TASK7-SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Status

**✅ COMPLETE** - All subtasks implemented and tested

Task 7 provides a production-ready webhook system that enables external integrations and real-time event notifications for the Modern Admin Styler V2 plugin.
