## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (1 hour before)

#### Step 1: Final Verification
```bash
# Run all tests one final time
./tests/run-phase2-e2e-tests.sh

# Verify system health
php verify-phase2-e2e-complete.php

# Check for any uncommitted changes
git status
```

**Expected Result:** All tests pass, no uncommitted changes

#### Step 2: Create Backup
```bash
# Backup current production database
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > backup_pre_phase2_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Backup current plugin files
tar -czf mas-v2-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz modern-admin-styler-v2/

# Verify backups
ls -lh backup_pre_phase2_*.sql
ls -lh mas-v2-backup-*.tar.gz
```

**Expected Result:** Backup files created successfully

#### Step 3: Notify Stakeholders
- [ ] Send deployment notification email
- [ ] Update status page (if applicable)
- [ ] Notify support team
- [ ] Prepare rollback team (if needed)

**Timeline:** T-60 minutes

---

### Phase 2: Deployment (30 minutes)

#### Step 4: Enable Maintenance Mode
```php
// Add to wp-config.php
define('WP_MAINTENANCE_MODE', true);
```

**Expected Result:** Site shows maintenance message

**Timeline:** T-0 minutes

#### Step 5: Deploy Code
```bash
# Option A: Via Git (recommended)
cd /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/modern-admin-styler-v2
git fetch origin
git checkout v2.3.0
git pull origin v2.3.0

# Option B: Manual upload
# 1. Upload new plugin files via FTP/SFTP
# 2. Replace existing files
# 3. Preserve wp-content/uploads/mas-v2/ directory

# Verify deployment
php -v  # Check PHP version
ls -la  # Verify files are in place
```

**Expected Result:** New files deployed successfully

**Timeline:** T+5 minutes

#### Step 6: Run Database Migrations
```bash
# Activate plugin (triggers migrations)
wp plugin activate modern-admin-styler-v2

# Or run migrations manually
php -r "require 'modern-admin-styler-v2.php'; 
        \$schema = new MAS_Database_Schema(); 
        \$schema->create_tables();"

# Verify migrations
php verify-phase2-database-schema.php
```

**Expected Result:** All tables created, migrations successful

**Timeline:** T+10 minutes

#### Step 7: Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check system health
wp eval "
  \$health = new MAS_System_Health_Service();
  print_r(\$health->get_health_status());
"

# Verify endpoints
curl -X GET "https://yoursite.com/wp-json/mas-v2/v1/system/health" \
  -H "X-WP-Nonce: YOUR_NONCE"

# Check database tables
mysql -u username -p -e "
  USE database_name;
  SHOW TABLES LIKE 'wp_mas_v2_%';
"
```

**Expected Result:** System health is "healthy", all endpoints respond

**Timeline:** T+15 minutes

#### Step 8: Clear Caches
```bash
# Clear WordPress object cache
wp cache flush

# Clear plugin cache
wp eval "
  \$cache = new MAS_Cache_Service();
  \$cache->flush();
"

# Clear CDN cache (if applicable)
# [Your CDN-specific commands here]

# Clear browser cache (instruct users)
```

**Expected Result:** All caches cleared

**Timeline:** T+20 minutes

#### Step 9: Disable Maintenance Mode
```php
// Remove from wp-config.php
// define('WP_MAINTENANCE_MODE', true);
```

**Expected Result:** Site is live again

**Timeline:** T+25 minutes

---

### Phase 3: Post-Deployment Verification (30 minutes)

#### Step 10: Smoke Tests
```bash
# Test critical endpoints
./tests/smoke-test-phase2.sh

# Test user workflows
# 1. Login to admin
# 2. Navigate to MAS settings
# 3. Preview a theme
# 4. Apply a theme
# 5. Create a backup
# 6. Check system health
```

**Expected Result:** All smoke tests pass

**Timeline:** T+30 minutes

#### Step 11: Monitor System
```bash
# Check error logs
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
tail -f /path/to/wordpress/wp-content/debug.log

# Monitor performance
wp eval "
  \$profiler = new MAS_Performance_Profiler();
  print_r(\$profiler->get_metrics());
"

# Check audit log
wp eval "
  \$logger = new MAS_Security_Logger_Service();
  print_r(\$logger->get_audit_log(['limit' => 10]));
"
```

**Expected Result:** No errors, performance within targets

**Timeline:** T+45 minutes

#### Step 12: Verify Analytics
```bash
# Check that analytics are being collected
wp eval "
  \$analytics = new MAS_Analytics_Service();
  print_r(\$analytics->get_usage_stats());
"

# Verify webhooks are working (if configured)
wp eval "
  \$webhooks = new MAS_Webhook_Service();
  print_r(\$webhooks->list_webhooks());
"
```

**Expected Result:** Analytics collecting, webhooks functional

**Timeline:** T+60 minutes

#### Step 5: Clear Caches
```bash
# Clear all caches
wp cache flush

# Clear plugin cache
wp eval "
  delete_transient('mas_v2_cache');
  delete_transient('mas_v2_settings_cache');
"
```

#### Step 6: Disable Maintenance Mode

        \$schema = new MAS_Database_Schema(); 
        \$schema->create_tables();"
```

#### Issue 2: Settings Not Saving
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check rate limiting
wp eval "
  \$limiter = new MAS_Rate_Limiter_Service();
  print_r(\$limiter->get_status());
"

# Clear rate limit if needed
wp eval "
  delete_transient('mas_v2_rate_limit_*');
"
```

#### Issue 3: Webhooks Not Delivering
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check webhook configuration
wp eval "
  \$webhooks = new MAS_Webhook_Service();
  print_r(\$webhooks->list_webhooks());
"

# Retry failed deliveries
wp eval "
  \$webhooks = new MAS_Webhook_Service();
  \$webhooks->retry_failed_deliveries();
"
```

#### Issue 4: Performance Degradation
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear all caches
wp cache flush

# Warm cache
wp eval "
  \$cache = new MAS_Cache_Service();
  \$cache->warm_cache();
"

# Check system health
wp eval "
  \$health = new MAS_System_Health_Service();
  print_r(\$health->get_health_status());
"
```
