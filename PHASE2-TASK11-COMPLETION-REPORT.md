   - Delivery history tracked

6. **Diagnostics ↔ System Health**
   - Health checks validate system state
   - Performance metrics collected

## Known Limitations

1. **Webhook Delivery Testing**
   - Tests use mock URLs (actual HTTP delivery not tested)
   - Retry mechanism timing is simulated

2. **Async Batch Processing**
   - Background job execution not fully tested
   - Status polling simulated

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Run in test environment (may differ from production)
   - Network latency not simulated

## Recommendations

1. **Add E2E Tests**

   - Real webhook delivery testing

2. **Load Testing**
   - Test with high concurrent request volume
   - Stress test rate limiting

3. **Security Audit**
   - Penetration testing
   - SQL injection testing
   - XSS vulnerability testing

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up continuous test execution
   - Track test performance over time

## Next Steps
