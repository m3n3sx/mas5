## What Was Fixed

### Before Emergency Stabilization

**Problems:**
- Three competing frontend systems causing conflicts
- Phase 3 frontend with broken dependencies (EventBus, StateManager, APIClient)
- Handler conflicts preventing settings from saving
- Live preview not functioning
- Users reporting "live mode not working and most options don't work"

**Architecture:**
```
Plugin Load
  └─> Feature Flag Check
      ├─> Phase 3 (broken) ❌
      │   ├─> EventBus.js (broken init)
      │   ├─> StateManager.js (broken deps)
      │   ├─> APIClient.js (not initialized)
      │   └─> mas-admin-app.js (depends on broken core)
      │
      └─> Phase 2 (working) ✅
          ├─> mas-rest-client.js
          ├─> mas-settings-form-handler.js
          └─> simple-live-preview.js
```

### After Emergency Stabilization

**Solutions:**
- Single, stable Phase 2 frontend system
- All broken Phase 3 code disabled
- Clean, direct script loading
- Feature flags hardcoded to prevent Phase 3
- Clear user communication about emergency mode

**Architecture:**
```
Plugin Load
  └─> ALWAYS Phase 2 (forced) ✅
      ├─> Emergency flags set
      ├─> mas-rest-client.js
      ├─> mas-settings-form-handler.js
      └─> simple-live-preview.js
```
